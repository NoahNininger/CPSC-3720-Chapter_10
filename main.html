<!--
    The below code will create a dynamic list of people that can be clicked, 
    and it will update the corresponding value with the number of times that 
    name was clicked. It also includes an input field that will allow you to 
    add more users to the list, each of which will create another item in the 
    list that can be interacted with the same as the default list items.

    Use the following HTML code as a template to add JavaScript to, 
    and provide your answer as the completed script element.

                <input type="text" id="addFriend">
                <input type="button" id="addNew" value="Add Friend">
            </div>
            <table id="output"></table>

    Take the following steps:

        1. Create an array of people's names called myArray. This will be
           the default original list of names.

        2. Select the page elements as JavaScript objects so they can
           easily be selected within the code.

        3. Add event listener to the Add Friend button. Once clicked, this
           will get the value from the input field and pass the values to a 
           function that will add the friend list to the page. Additionally, 
           add the new friend's name into the people's names array you created. 
           Get the current value in the input field and push that value into 
           the array so the array matches the values on the page.

        4. Run a function to build the content on the page, using the 
           forEach() loop get all the items within the array and add them to 
           the page. Include 0 as a default for the vote count, as all 
           individuals should start on zero votes.

        5. Create a main function that will create the page elements, starting 
           with the parent table row, tr. Then create three table cell, td, 
           elements. Add content to the table cells, including the vote count 
           in the last column, the person name in the middle, and the index 
           plus 1 in the first column.

        6. Append the table cells to the table row and append the table row 
           to the output area on the page.

        7. Add an event listener that will increase the vote counter for that 
           row when the user clicks.

        8. Get the text content from the last column in the row. It should be
           the value of the current counter. Increment the counter by one and make 
           sure the datatype is a number so you can add to it.
        
        9. Update the last column with the new click counter.
